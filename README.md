# CPP-Bindings

C++ bindings for low level communication with the OS. These bindings provide functions to `open`, `close`, `read`, `write`, etc. to or from a serial connection. The functions than can be used through a [dynamic link library](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Link_Library) or [shared object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries).

## Documentation
Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/Serial-Link/CPP-Bindings/wiki) section on how to use these bindings.
