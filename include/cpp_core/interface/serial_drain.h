     * @brief Wait until the operating-system driver has physically sent every queued byte.
     *
     * The function blocks the *calling thread* until the device driver reports
     * that the transmit FIFO is **empty** â€“ i.e. all bytes handed to previous
     * `serialWrite*` calls have been shifted out on the wire.  It does *not*
     * flush higher-level protocol buffers you may have implemented yourself.
     *
     * Typical use-case: ensure a complete command frame has left the UART
     * before toggling RTS/DTR or powering down the device.
     *
     * @code{.c}
     * // Send a frame and make sure it actually hits the line
     * serialWrite(h, frame, frame_len, 50, 1);
     * if (serialDrain(h) < 0) {
     *     fprintf(stderr, "drain failed\n");
     * }
     * @endcode
     *
     * @param handle Port handle.
     * @return 0 on success; negative ::cpp_core::StatusCodes value on error.
